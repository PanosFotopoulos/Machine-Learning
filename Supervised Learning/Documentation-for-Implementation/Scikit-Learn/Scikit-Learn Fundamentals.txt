Scikit learn is a machine learning library in python. 
Cores feature:
    Algorithms
    Preprocession
    Model Seletion
    Dataspets (Iris)
    Neighbors

Scikit-learn also got a powerfull tool. A powerfull function called Train-Test-Split that provides you, test size, train size,random state, shuffle etc.

Very important tool because you have:

Validation: It provides an unbiased evaluation of your model by testing it on data it hasnt seen during training.

Generalization: Helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data rather than just memorizing the training data.
By using train_test_split, you can effectively evaluate the performance of your machine learning models and avoid overfitting.
