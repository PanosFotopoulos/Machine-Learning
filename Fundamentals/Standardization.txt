To standardize a dataset means to scale all of the values in the dataset such that the mean value is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.
This can be achived with the library from sklearn called StandarScaler from sklearn.preprocessing

Standardization helps to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandarScaler 
Mean = 0: The average value of each feature will be zero
Variance = 1: The standard deviation of each feature will be one, meaning the data will be spread out in a standard normal distribution.

Mean Calculation(.mean()):

Mean =  (-1.34164079 + ( -  0.4472136 ) + 0.4472136 + 1.34164079) / 4 = 0, The mean is 0, as expected.

Standard Deviation Calculation(.std()):

Variance = (-1.34164079-0)^2 + (-0.4472136-0)^2 + (0.4472136-0)^2 + (1.34164079-0)^2 / 4 = 1, Taking the square root of the variance gives us the standard deviation, which is 1.

Now that is very clear what mean and std is and how scaler works lets scale our data.

First step. Allow the scaler to learn how to scale the data properly with .fit

scaler.fit(X_train) In this step computes the mean and the standard deviation of each feature in X_train, Only fit on training data to prevend data leakage (SOS)
 
Second step. Transfrom our data

X_train = scaler.transfrom(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
