Regression Models

The two most used function in order to evalute the perfomance of a regression model (Loss) are MSE and magnitude:

Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Calculate the average of the squares of the difference between the actual values and the predicted values .
MSE = mean_squared_error(y_test,test_prediction) 
And its commonly used as a loss function during the training of the models (regression models, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
(Heart of the data)


Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
Calcualate the average of the absolute of the difference between the actual values and the predicted values.
MAE = mean_absolute_error(y_test,prediction)
And gives more weight to the extremes or outliers in your predictions
(Outliers of the data)


Classification Models

Accuracy Score is used to evaluate the prediction on a Classification model

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report
evaluation = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred) *there is an Accuracy paradox so i should plot things with confusion matrix
confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred)
