Scikit learn is a machine learning library in python. 
Cores feature:
    Algorithms
    Preprocession
    Model Seletion
    Dataspets (Iris)
    Neighbors

Scikit-learn also got a powerfull tool. A powerfull function called Train-Test-Split that provides you, test size, train size,random state, shuffle etc.

Very important tool because you have:

Validation: It provides an unbiased evaluation of your model by testing it on data it hasnt seen during training.

Generalization: Helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data rather than just memorizing the training data.
By using train_test_split, you can effectively evaluate the performance of your machine learning models and avoid overfitting.

Some of the most used modules and functions are 

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandarScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

Sklearn pipelines are specific machine learning workflows, used to streamline the process of preprocessing data, fitting a model
and making a prediction. For example a pipeline might include steps for scaling data, transforming and then applying a ML Algorithms
A very usefull tool but you need to be very carefull.
