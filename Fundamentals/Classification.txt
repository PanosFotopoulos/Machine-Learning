Classification is a method in machine learning and AI based on classes or categorise. The model is trained on a label dataset meaning each example in dataset
is associated with a knows class label

Key concepts of Classification:

    Classes or Categorise: For example Spam, not Spam output. These are the possible labels that the model can assign to an input.
    Input Data: Maybe the data needs to be classfied 
    Output: The result of the Classification process is a predicted class label for each instance of input data
    Training Data: To build a classification model, you need a dataset where each example is already labeled with the correct class.
        The model learns from this data, identifying patterns that help it predict the class labels of new, unseen examples.    

Types of Classification:
    Binary Classification: This invoves two classes. 
        E.g. True False, 1/2, yes no.
    Multyclass Classification: There are three categorise of an article "Sports", "Politics", "Economy". 
        An article can belong to only one class 
    Multilabel Classification: There are three categorise of an article "Sports", "Politics", "Economy". 
        An article can belong to more than one class simultaneously
